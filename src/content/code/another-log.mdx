#### Prompts

> Build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. It should use shadcn components and have a green theme. See attached screenshot for the design. Users should be able to Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person, View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size, and See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Please use the following design as a reference.
